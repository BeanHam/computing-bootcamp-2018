## Before we start

A couple things to get everyone on the same page

- If you don't have one, sign up for a GitHub account (it takes 1 min.)
    + Go to https://github.com/join
    + Enter your information
    + Pick the `Unlimited public repositories for free.` plan

<br/>

- Try logging on to one of the department's RStudio servers
    + https://smith.stat.duke.edu:8787
    + Login and password are your `netid` and associated password.


## Username advice


* Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.

* Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.

* Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

* Shorter is better than longer.

* Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.

* Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.

* Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming.

# Reproducibility: who cares?

## Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author LaCour

- In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway 
people's opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months ago.

- Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: Original survey data not made 
available for independent reproduction of results. + Survey incentives 
misrepresented. + Sponsorship statement false.

- Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly 
discovered that the data must have been faked.

- Methods we'll discuss today can't prevent this, but they can make it 
easier to discover issues.

## Seizure study retracted after authors realize data got "terribly mixed"

From the authors of **Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in 
Preterm Neonates**:

*"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After 
carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified 
that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published 
results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical 
correctness."*

## Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

- The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other 
survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the 
identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set 
in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results 
reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct.

- **Original conclusion:** Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with 
current depression and with future depression [...].

- **Revised conclusion:** Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were 
associated with current depression [...].

# Reproducibility: why should we care?

## Two-pronged approach

<div class="columns-2">
\#1 
Convince researchers to adopt a reproducible research workflow

<br><br>

\#2
Train new researchers who don’t have any other workflow

<center>
![](img/two-pronged-fork.jpg)
</center>

</div>

## Reproducible data analysis

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R

- Literate programming $\rightarrow$ R Markdown

- Version control $\rightarrow$ git / GitHub


# Scripting and literate programming 

## Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: 
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what 
to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we 
want a computer to do."

"The practitioner of literate programming [...] strives for a program that 
is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order 
that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and 
informal methods that reinforce each other."

- These ideas have been around for years!
- and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
- but they have never been as accessible as the current tools


## Reproducibility checklist

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how 
were parameter settings chosen?)
- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Ambitious goal + many other concerns 

We need an environment where

- data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, 
inseparable

- reproducibility is built in
    + the original data remains untouched
    + all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

- documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

## Toolkit

<center>
![](img/toolkit.png)
</center>

## What is markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating HTML (or XHTML) 
documents.

- Markup languages are designed to produce documents from human readable 
text (and annotations).

- Some of you may be familiar with LaTeX. This is another (less human 
friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- Why I love Markdown:
    + Easy to learn and use.
    + Focus on **content**, rather than **coding** and debugging 
    **errors**.
    + Once you have the basics down, you can get fancy and add HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS.
    
## Why should I use Markdown?

If you have an annoying process for authoring for the web ...

or

If you avoid authoring for the web, because you're not sure how ...

**start writing in Markdown**!


# Using RStudio

## Accessing RStudio

- Go to 
    + PhD: http://smith.stat.duke.edu:8787/
    + MS: http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787/
    + UG: http://gort.stat.duke.edu:8787/

- Log in with your `netid` and password

## A brief foray into GitHub

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dpeGSpubszU?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


## R packages {.smaller}

- Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include 
reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, 
and sample data.

- In the following exercises we'll use the **tidyverse** package
    + The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
    + The core tidyverse package consists of **ggplot2**, **tibble**, **tidyr**, **readr**, **purrr**, **dplyr**, **stringr**, and **forcats** packages.
    
- This package is already installed for you on the server, but elsewhere you can 
install it by running the following in the *Console*

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- You also need to load this package

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## A note on workspaces

- Your R Markdown document and your Console do **not** share workspaces

- This is good for reproducibility, but can sometimes result in frustrating 
errors

- This also means any packages needed for your analysis need to be loaded in 
your R Markdown document as well

## It's your lucky day, you got some data!

Load the data using the `read.csv` function

```{r}
gap <- read_csv("https://bit.ly/gap_data")
```

## Tidy data

## Exercise 1

**How many observations are in this dataset?**

```{r}
nrow(gap)
```

## Exercise 2 {.smaller}

**Visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy for countries in Europe in 1952 using a scatter plot.**

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7}
eu_52 <- gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year == 1952)
ggplot(data = eu_52, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()                                          
```

## Exercise 3

**Ex 2: Add year 1967 in another color.**

1. Create a subset of `gap` for Europe in 1952 **and 1967** and call it 
`eu_5267`. Some hints to get you started:

    + Update your subset to also include 1952: `year %in% c(1952, 1967)`.
    + Update the name of the resulting data frame to `eu_5267`
    
2. Create the plot. Some more hints:

    + Update the name of the data frame being referred to in the `ggplot` 
    function.
    + Add another aesthetic to the plot for plotting data from th two 
    years in difference colors: `color = factor(year)`. Note that this 
    says the color of the points should be determined by the year, and 
    that we should consider year as a categorical (factor) variable 
    (either 1952 or 1967).

##

```{r, fig.height=3.75, fig.width=7}
eu_5267 <- gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe", year %in% c(1952, 1967))
ggplot(data = eu_5267, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = factor(year))) +
  geom_point()                                          
```

## REDO!

**Ex REDO: Your collaborator realized that the data set they sent you 
was wrong. Repeat Exercises 1 and 2 with the updated dataset.**

```{r}
gap_upd <- read.csv("https://bit.ly/gap_data_upd")
```

## Organizing a more complex analysis

- Use folders: raw_data, processed_data, code, figures, etc.

- Number your script files:
    + `00_load_data.R`
    + `01_data_cleanup.R`
    + `02_eda.R`
    + ...

- Use informative names that indicate versioning
    + use dates
    + avoid things like `project_fin`, `project_finalfinal`, etc.

# Departmental computing resources

## Departmental computing resources

- Graduate student computers are shared departmental resources
    + You'll be assigned a desktop to which you have priority, but it may 
    be used by others as well (and you can use others' later if needed -- 
    more on this later)

- Dedicated servers: 
    + `gort`: Undergrad
    + `saxon`: MS
    + `smith`: PhD
    
- Home directories are all network shared and backed up

- DSS computing inventory: https://www2.stat.duke.edu/lib/computer_inventory.php


# On to ssh

## Remote connections

- You will be doing much of your work on remote linux systems, primarily 
you will be interacting with these machines through a remote terminal and 
a shell. Using a shell gives you more power to do more tasks more 
efficiently with your computer.

- OSX / Unix / Linux - these tools should already be installed and you 
should be able to access your shell through the Terminal application (name 
may vary slightly depending on your OS).

- Windows - there are several ways to install bash or a bash-like shell, 
the preferred method is to install the `git for windows` package: 
https://git-for-windows.github.io/.

## Secure shell (ssh)

- A secure tool for connecting and interacting with remote systems
- Uses public key encryption
- Run a single command or work interactively
- Lots of other neat tricks (proxying, port forwarding, etc.)

## Connecting to saxon / smith

- PhD: `smith`, MS: `saxon`
- Everyone should have a visitor account of the stats servers now
- Try to connect to make sure everything is working...

```bash
$ ssh cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu
The authenticity of host 'saxon.stat.duke.edu (152.3.7.55)' can't be established
.
RSA key fingerprint is 74:30:5a:d0:cd:a8:d2:6f:a6:e9:c6:80:bb:eb:b4:ba.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?yes
cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu's password:
[cr173@saxon ~]$
```

## Working remotely {.smaller}

You should now be able to run commands remotely on `saxon`. We can 
interactively run commands on the remote system. Try `lscpu` to see the 
cpu configuration on server.

```bash
[cr173@saxon ~]$ lscpu

```

## Finishing up

Once you are done on the server you can exit by:

- Running `exit`
- Ctrl-D
- Wait long enough (connection will time out)
